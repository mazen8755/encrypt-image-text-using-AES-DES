The system offers flexibility by allowing users to select from five encryption modes: Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR), along with two widely studied block ciphers: Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Upon user selection, the system dynamically generates appropriately sized keys and auxiliary values such as Initialization Vectors (IVs), Nonces, or Counters as necessary. It is worth noting that Counter Mode (CTR) is not available for DES due to its small block size, which may impact efficiency. Through this project, users gain practical insights into encryption methodologies, empowering them to make informed decisions about securing their digital assets
